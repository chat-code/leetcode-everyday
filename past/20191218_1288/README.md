1288. Remove Covered Intervals 
Medium


Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list. Interval [a,b) is covered by interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

After doing so, return the number of remaining intervals.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
 


```

Constraints:

- 1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
- 0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5
- intervals[i] != intervals[j] for all i != j
